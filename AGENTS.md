# Repository Agent Rules

- After making changes in this repo, create a small, descriptive commit by default.
- Do not push commits automatically in this repo.
- Before handing off changes, start the site locally from the repo root with `npm run dev -- --host` so the user can review it first.
- The user decides when to push changes.
